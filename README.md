# AndroidCarPoolDriver

AndroidCarPoolDriver is an android app for a person who wishes to pick up passengers when driving their vehicle to another location. The benefit for the drivers is that they get compensated for the travel, as cost is calculated by the km driven with the current gas price. Drivers create tickets of their travel where they provide details such as locations, destination, time number of seats, date and time need to be provided for the user to be able to filter out the ride they need.
